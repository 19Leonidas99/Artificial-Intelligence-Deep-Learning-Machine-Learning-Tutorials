    "##  Automatic Differentiation with Eager Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation):\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD), also called algorithmic differentiation or computational differentiation,[1][2] is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. AD exploits the fact that every computer program, no matter how complicated, executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.) and elementary functions (exp, log, sin, cos, etc.). By applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations, derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically, accurately to working precision, and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation is not:\n",
    "- Symbolic differentiation, nor\n",
    "- Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences).\n",
    "\n",
    "These classical methods run into problems: symbolic differentiation leads to inefficient code (unless carefully done) and faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single expression, while numerical differentiation can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation. Both classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where the complexity and errors increase. Finally, both classical methods are slow at computing the partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms. Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems, at the expense of introducing more software dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/AutomaticDifferentiationNutshell.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Automatic Differentiation** in TensorFlow is useful when implementing several deep learning algorithms. Eager Execution provides an autograd-like API for automatic differentiation, especially for functions such as these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tfe.gradients_function(f)` : This returns a python function that computes the derivatives of the python function `f` w.r.t its arguments. `f` should return a scalr value. When invoeked this function returns a list of `Tensor` objects (an element for each argument of `f`)\n",
    "- `tfe.value_and_gradients_function(f)` : Just like the above function this one returns , when invoked, the value of `f` in addition to the list of derivatives of `f` w.r.t its arguments.\n",
