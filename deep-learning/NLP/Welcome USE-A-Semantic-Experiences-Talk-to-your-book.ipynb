    "# The Mighty USE of NLP -- Universal Sentence Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates how to access the Universal Sentence Encoder and use it for sentence similarity and sentence classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Universal Sentence Encoder makes getting sentence level embeddings as easy as it has historically been to lookup the embeddings for individual words. The sentence embeddings can then be trivially used to compute sentence level meaning similarity as well as to enable better performance on downstream classification tasks using less supervised training data.\n",

    "[Natural language understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_understanding) has evolved substantially in the past few years, in part due to the development of [word vectors](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/word2vec) that enable algorithms to learn about the relationships between words, based on examples of actual language usage. These vector models map semantically similar phrases to nearby points based on equivalence, similarity or relatedness of ideas and language. Last year, we used hierarchical vector models of language to make improvements to [Smart Reply for Gmail](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/05/efficient-smart-reply-now-for-gmail.html). More recently, we’ve been exploring other applications of these methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we are proud to share Semantic Experiences, a website showing two examples of how these new capabilities can drive applications that weren’t possible before. Talk to Books is an entirely new way to explore books by starting at the sentence level, rather than the author or topic level. Semantris is a word association game powered by machine learning, where you type out words associated with a given prompt. We have also published “Universal Sentence Encoder”, or as I call it **USE** which describes the models used for these examples in more detail. Lastly, we’ve provided a [pretrained semantic TensorFlow module](https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder/1) for the community to experiment with their own sentence and phrase encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modeling approach\n",
    "Our approach extends the idea of representing language in a vector space by creating vectors for larger chunks of language such as full sentences and small paragraphs. Since language is composed of hierarchies of concepts, we create the vectors using a hierarchy of modules, each of which considers features that correspond to sequences at different temporal scales. Relatedness, synonymy, antonymy, meronymy, holonymy, and many other types of relationships may all be represented in vector space language models if we train them in the right way and then pose the right “questions”. We describe this method in our paper, [“Efficient Natural Language Response for Smart Reply.”](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00652) \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Talk to Books\n",
    "\n",
    "With [Talk to Books](https://books.google.com/talktobooks), we provide an entirely new way to explore books. You make a statement or ask a question, and the tool finds sentences in books that respond, with no dependence on keyword matching. In a sense you are talking to the books, getting responses which can help you determine if you’re interested in reading them or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "A bit more on the Pre-trained model\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering and other natural language tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable length English text and the output is a 512 dimensional vector. We apply this model to the STS benchmark for semantic similarity, and the results can be seen in the example notebook made available. To learn more about text embeddings, refer to the TensorFlow Embeddings documentation. Our encoder differs from word level embedding models in that we train on a number of natural language prediction tasks that require modeling the meaning of word sequences rather than just individual words. Details are available in the paper \"Universal Sentence Encoder\" [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/example-similarity.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Semantic similarity** is a measure of the degree to which two pieces of text carry the same meaning. This is broadly useful in obtaining good coverage over the numerous ways that a thought can be expressed using language without needing to manually enumerate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple applications include improving the coverage of systems that trigger behaviors on certain keywords, phrases or utterances. This section of the notebook shows how to encode text and compare encoding distances as a proxy for semantic similarity."
