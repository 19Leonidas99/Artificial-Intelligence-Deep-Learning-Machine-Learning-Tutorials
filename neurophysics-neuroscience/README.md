# Evolutionary Neurual Network Frameworks


## Nengo

[Nengo](https://www.nengo.ai) is a graphical and scripting based software package for simulating large-scale neural systems. The book How to build a brain, which includes Nengo tutorials, is now available. This website also has additional information on the book.

To use Nengo, you define groups of neurons in terms of what they represent, and then form connections between neural groups in terms of what computation should be performed on those representations. Nengo then uses the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) to solve for the appropriate synaptic connection weights to achieve this desired computation. Nengo also supports various kinds of learning. Nengo helps make detailed spiking neuron models that implement complex high-level cognitive algorithms.

Among other things, Nengo has been used to implement motor control, visual attention, serial recall, action selection, working memory, attractor networks, inductive reasoning, path integration, and planning with problem solving (see the model archives and publications for details).

Here's a small explanation of Nengo

Chris Eliasmith has also written a book called ["How to build a brain"](https://www.amazon.com/How-Build-Brain-Architecture-Architectures/dp/0190262125)


## Wyrm

Wyrm is a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) toolbox written in Python. Wyrm is suitable for running on-line BCI experiments as well as off-line analysis of EEG data.

Online documentation is available [here](http://bbci.github.io/wyrm/) and a full explanation of architecture and methdology is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626531/)

## Blue Brain Project

The Blue Brain Python Optimisation Library (BluePyOpt) is an extensible framework for data-driven model parameter optimisation that wraps and standardises several existing open-source tools.

It simplifies the task of creating and sharing these optimisations, and the associated techniques and knowledge. This is achieved by abstracting the optimisation and evaluation tasks into various reusable and flexible discrete elements according to established best-practices.

Further, BluePyOpt provides methods for setting up both small- and large-scale optimisations on a variety of platforms, ranging from laptops to Linux clusters and cloud-based compute infrastructures.
